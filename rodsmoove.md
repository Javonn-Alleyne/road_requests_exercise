## Python:  Let's delve into the differences between the Command Line and JSON in Python.

# Findings 

1. **Command Line**:
  * The requests library in Python is used for making HTTP requests.
  * It provides an easy-to-use interface to interact with web services and APIs.
  * It allows you to send various types of HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  * You can also handle request headers, parameters, authentication, cookies, and more with the requests library.

    


2. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**:
  * JSON is a lightweight data interchange format.
  * It is primarily used for transmitting data between a server and a web application as text.
  * In Python, the json module provides functions for encoding and decoding JSON data.
  * It allows you to serialize Python objects (convert them to JSON format) and deserialize JSON data into Python objects.
  * JSON data is represented as key-value pairs and supports arrays and nested structures.

**Main Differences**: 
* requests is a library for making HTTP requests, whereas JSON is a data interchange format.
* requests is used to interact with web services and APIs, while JSON is used to structure and transmit data.
* requests deals with making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing the communication with web servers, while JSON deals with encoding and decoding data into a format that can be easily transmitted and understood.
  

**In summary**, requests and JSON serve different purposes in Python: requests is for making HTTP requests, and JSON is for serializing and deserializing data. However, they are often used together when interacting with web APIs, where requests is used to communicate with the API server, and JSON is used to format the data being sent or received.

**website review**: while exploring this collection on the website there's alot to see. Images of record covers along with sheets of music, In addition they also have a smaller selection of historic sound recordings illustrating these sounds and many others by the same composers. 
In short, the website view represents a visual presentation.
