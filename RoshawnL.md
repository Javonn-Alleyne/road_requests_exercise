I chose the "America Singing: Nineteenth-Century Song Sheets" for this exercise(https://www.loc.gov/collections/nineteenth-century-song-sheets/).
#### About this Collection:
   Contains 4291 song sheets. Included among these American songs are ninety-seven British song sheets from Dublin and London. The collection spans the period from the turn of the nineteenth century to the 1880s, although a majority of the song sheets were published during the height of the craze, from the 1850s to the 1870s. Held by the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress.
#### The History of Song Sheets
For most of the nineteenth century, before the advent of phonograph and radio technologies, Americans learned the latest songs from printed song sheets. Not to be confused with sheet music, song sheets are single printed sheets, usually six by eight inches, with lyrics but no music. These were new songs being sung in music halls or new lyrics to familiar songs. Some of America's most beloved tunes were printed as song sheets, including "The Star Spangled Banner" and "Battle Hymn of the Republic." 
#### Conclusion
The variety of subjects and viewpoints conveyed by song sheets make them a unique and indispensable historical resource. The title of this digital collection comes from Walt Whitman's poem "I Hear America Singing." It was published in Leaves of Grass, at a time when song sheets were enjoying immense popularity. The nation had indeed been singing, and the songs they sang continue to tell the American story.

#### Browser JSON View 
* Each collection item is identified by "number:"(for e.g "0:", "1:") and is segmented into several variables which provide details about the item
* The ability to collapse certain sections along with the indentation increased its readability

#### Python Console JSON View 
* Each collection item is identified by braces("{}") and is segmented into several variables which provide details about the item.
  * Variables that contain multiple variables/items use square brackets("[]")
* The information was somewhat squished together which, while discernible under close review, became muddled and overwhelming when looked at as a whole 

#### General Thoughts/Observations
* Overall the website was easy to navigate
 * Individual items are clearly seperated and the filters along the side such as date and location would be very helpful for persons who know specifically what they want
* There were repeat copies of the same items, though they were from notably different sources(paper quality, completely different sheets)

#### JSON Thoughts/Observations   
* Browser JSON View is much easier to read than the Python JSON view since it is collapsible and laid out cleaner
* Was reasonably easy to see the correlation between the JSON variables and what the user sees through the regular site view
* Information not visible from the web page view could be seen
