For this assignment i have chosen the _Civil Rights History Project_ collection. This collection contains 158 items but only 157 are available online. The collection covers historical views on the movement for equality for African Americans which gained traction in 1955 when the murder of a fourteen year African American boy galvanized many young people into joining the movement.

The collect is made up of video files,images and web articles.

### Webpage

I like how the site caters to people with disability with the read to me function available on the home pages. While reviewing some of the video interviews I found that the interviewer's, Mr Mosnier, voice was too low at least compared to the interviewee. I had to put in earbubs to hear the question he was asking.

### Json Format
In this format we see when collapsed to results we have 25 lines that all expand and shows the the first 25 items of the collection. In each expansion we have attributes on the item. 



### Command-Line
The command-line view is basically a code and content all together with no formatting making it hard to read and understand.

From an enduser point of view the normal webpage view is the easy view to access the content of the collection. For developers the json format gives you more useful information on the item to allow you to manipulate the data. So, maybe during the development of the site they used the JSON format for its readability and simplicity to idenitfiy what they wanted to include in the site given the target audience(s).
