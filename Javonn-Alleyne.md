# Requeest Exercise
The collection I have chosen to request is the ["Country-Profiles Colleciton"](https://www.loc.gov/collections/country-profiles/).
This collection was written between 2004-2008, detailing breif summaries on countries listed in the collection

# Displaying the first page
They are three ways to display the data and items of the collection.
## Webpage Format
The webpage format makes use of a GUI (graphical user interface) making this format the easiest to read and navigate. It features the itmess neatly organised in a single row, stacked vertically, separated by dividing lines. The items in the collection are displayed with an image of the countries documented profile, along with a preview or abstract of the data within the document placed to its right. On the left they are various sub categories and options to customise the viewing of the items or to narrow down a search.
## JSON format 
The JSON format takes all the information, or meta data, on all the items from the webpage. It displays this data almost like a text file. It has similar data that is present on the webpage. However its ability to be easily read and navigated is gone. Now a user must carefully read through all of the available text to find the data or item they want from the collection. This of course will increase the amount of time spent on the collection. Also all of the items are displayed in a test-like format with no spaces or dividing lines between the further increasing its difficult readability and the time spent on the data.
## Command Format
With the command line format, it to also makes use of the JASON format, using the "import json" line on the consoel, and breaks it down into smaller code blocks separated and divided among "{}', "[]" and " "" ". It still presents the issues of being difficult to read as an individual will have to read through each code block upon first viewing to find what the need. However this can be mitigated if they are experienced with command line interfaces.

Your console is printing so much that it's interfering with other users, so it has been closed :)*

# Final Thoughts
I believe that a combination of two formats can results in maximising what can be searched and gathered on the page. The webpage is an obvious candidate due to its ease of use and "friendly" nature. The command line format can also be powerful due to its advanced properties for searching and potential automation. The raw JSON format however its too much of a complicated mess to read through and extract information.Using pure JSOn will take up too much time.
